# To-do-list with Mysql and Bootstrap 5

I made this project for training skills on PHP, Object Oriented Programming and MVC architecture by extension. Like the title implies, I also use Bootstrap 5 for the templates.


## Functionalities

A To-do-List is a very classic project. But this one include some functionalities to push a little further:
- A Mysql database
- User authentication and sessions
- Add, edit and delete tasks
- Error message. Even if I think we can improve them if it was a serious project.


## Installation

Simply download the repo and create the database with the 'to-do-list.sql' file. Then, setup the project on your local server.
